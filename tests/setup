# Create git repositories for tests. The chunk repository will contain a 
# simple "hello, world" C program, and two branches ("master", "farrokh"), 
# with the master branch containing just a README. The two branches are there
# so that we can test building a branch that hasn't been checked out.
# The branches are different so that we know that if the wrong branch
# is uses, the build will fail.
#
# The stratum repository contains a single branch, "master", with a
# stratum and a system morphology that include the chunk above.
