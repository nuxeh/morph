## Guard against a bug that occurs if 'git show-ref' is used to resolve refs
## instead of 'git rev-parse --verify': show-ref returns a list of partial
## matches sorted alphabetically, so any code using it may resolve refs

## The 'autotools' build system is defined in the DEFAULTS file created
## by the 'setup' script.
