`morph` builds binaries for [Baserock](http://www.baserock.org/),
an appliance Linux solution. Please see the website for overall information.


Usage
-----

The Baserock builds are controlled by Baserock definitions files.
See the documentation at <http://wiki.baserock.org/definitions/current>
for information on the format.

`morph --help` will provide some information, though a full guide is
really required. Meanwhile a short usage to build a disk image:

    git clone git://git.baserock.org/baserock/baserock/definitions
    cd definitions
    morph build systems/base-system-x86_64-generic.morph

For deploying you need to create a cluster morphology. Here is an
example to deploy to a raw disk image.

    name: base-system-x86_64-rawdisk
    kind: cluster
    systems:
    - morph: systems/base-system-x86_64-generic.morph
      deploy:
          my-raw-disk-image:
              type: extensions/rawdisk
              location: base-system-x86_64.img
              DISK_SIZE: 4G

To deploy it, you only need to run `morph deploy` with the cluster morphology
created:

    morph deploy foo.morph

You can write a configuration file to avoid having to write options on
the command line every time. Put it in `~/.morph.conf` and make it look
something like this:

    [config]
    cachedir = /home/username/baserock/cache
    log = /home/username/baserock/morph.log
    log-max = 200M
    trove-host = git.baserock.org

All of the above settings apart from `log` are the defaults, so may be omitted.


Running `morph` outside Baserock
--------------------------------

It used to be the case that `morph` had to be run from within an existing
Baserock system, however it is now possible to run `morph` from a general
Linux host system; this has currently been demonstrated to work on Debian,
Ubuntu and Fedora on x86_64, and Ubuntu on 64-bit little-endian ARMv8.

Morph needs to be run as root user. As such, system configurations required to
run `morph` independently, and which are tied to a particular user, must also
be applied to root.

* Install dependencies (on Debian-like systems)

    sudo apt-get install linux-user-chroot python-pip build-essential git m4

* Install dependencies (on Fedora systems)

    sudo dnf install linux-user-chroot python-pip git m4
    sudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel

* Install dependencies (all)

    sudo pip install --user fs pylru jsonschema pyyaml

* Set-up

    sudo git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
    sudo git config --global user.email 'your.email@address.org'

* Clone sources

    git clone git://git.baserock.org/baserock/baserock/definitions.git
    git clone git://git.baserock.org/baserock/baserock/morph.git
    cd definitions

* Start a build

    sudo ../morph/morph build systems/base-system-x86_64-generic.morph

You may optionally create a `/root/.morph.conf` configuration in the same way
as above to configure `morph`, for example to add a log file.


Build environment
-----------------

When `morph` runs build commands, it clears the environment of all
variables and creates new ones. This is so that the build will run
more consistently across machines and developers.

See the `morphlib/buildenvironment.py` file for details on what
environment variables are set.

Morph also constructs a staging area for every build, composed of its
build-dependencies, so everything that is used for a build is traceable
and reproducible.


Hacking morph
-------------

When running Morph from a Git checkout, remember to set PYTHONPATH to
point to your checkout. This will cause Morph to load the plugins and
write extensions from your checkout correctly.

Run the test suite with this command:

    ./check

If your /tmp is a tmpfs you may need to set TMPDIR to a different path,
as there are tests for large disk image deploys.

Install CoverageTestRunner (from <http://liw.fi/coverage-test-runner/>),
and check out the `cmdtest` utility (from <http://liw.fi/cmdtest/>).

Run the checks before submitting a patch, please.
