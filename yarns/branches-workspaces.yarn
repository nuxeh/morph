Morph black box tests for system branches and workspaces
========================================================

Anchoring commits for reproducibility
-------------------------------------

For full reproducibility, we need to ensure we anchor the commits we use.
`morph anchor` handles making this easier by pushing refs to the repositories
we use.

    SCENARIO morph anchors commits used by a release
    GIVEN    a git server

We don't strictly need a workspace to anchor commits, but we need to run morph
from somewhere.

    GIVEN    a workspace
    WHEN     the user checks out the system branch called master

The `morph anchor` command must be given a semantic name, to make the anchor
refs less opaque to humans, and allow anchor ref cleanup by semantic name, such
as when a given release is no longer supported.

    WHEN     the user attempts to anchor systems/test-system.morph with semantic name foo-release in branch master
    THEN     morph succeeded

After the `morph anchor` command completes, there are branches on the git
server in every repository used by the listed systems referring to the commits
used.

    AND      every commit used in master has anchor branches on the git server

`morph anchor` needs to handle being told to create anchors when they already
exist for that system, as we may have forgotten to anchor a system as part of a
release, and systems likely share contents.

    WHEN     the user attempts to anchor systems/test-system.morph with semantic name foo-release in branch master
    THEN     morph succeeded
    AND      every commit used in master has anchor branches on the git server

`morph anchor` will roll back any pushes when it is unable to push, and report
failure. To test this we need a new system to anchor.

    GIVEN    a new system to build called expanded-system
    AND      push access is denied to extra-chunk
    WHEN     the user creates a system branch called two, based on master
    AND      the user attempts to anchor systems/expanded-system.morph with semantic name foo-release in branch two
    THEN     morph failed

When this happens `morph anchor` must not remove anchors that already existed
before attempting to anchor, as they may be from a different system that shares
some components.

    THEN     every commit used in master has anchor branches on the git server
    FINALLY  the git server is shut down

Manifests
---------

Generating a manifest works

    SCENARIO    morph generates a manifest
    GIVEN       a workspace
    AND         a system artifact
    WHEN        morph generates a manifest
    THEN        the manifest is generated

A CSV manifest can also be generated.

    SCENARIO morph generates a csv manifest
    GIVEN    a git server

    WHEN     morph generates a manifest for system systems/test-system.morph at ref HEAD in repository test:morphs
    THEN     morph succeeded
    AND      the csv manifest is generated

Definition diffing
------------------

    SCENARIO diff reporting changes
    GIVEN    a workspace
    AND      a git server

    WHEN     the user checks out the system branch called master
    AND      chunk repository test-chunk is re-tagged as test-tag
    AND      chunk test-chunk in stratum strata/core.morph in system branch master is updated to use HEAD from chunk repository test-chunk
    AND      the user commits all changes in system branch master
    AND      the user requests a definition diff on all systems on branches HEAD and HEAD^ in system branch master

    THEN     morph succeeded
    AND      morph output test-tag

### diff implementations

    IMPLEMENTS WHEN the user requests a definition diff on all systems on branches (\S+) and (\S+) in system branch (\S+)
    repo="$DATADIR/workspace/$MATCH_3/test/morphs"
    attempt_morph diff "$repo" "$MATCH_1" - "$repo" "$MATCH_2" -

Certify
-------

`morph certify` can be used to get an indication whether or not building
a system is likely to have a reproducible result.

    SCENARIO using morph certify
    GIVEN    a git server

    WHEN     the user certifies the system systems/test-system.morph at ref HEAD in repository test:morphs
    THEN     morph succeeded
    AND      morph output Reproducibility certification PASSED

Listing artifacts in a system
-----------------------------

The `morph list-artifacts` command can be used to list the names of each
artifact in a system. This name includes the cache key of the artifact.

    SCENARIO using morph list-artifacts
    GIVEN    a git server

    WHEN     the user lists the artifacts which make up the system systems/test-system.morph at ref HEAD in repository test:morphs
    THEN     morph succeeded
