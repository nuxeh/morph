TAG_PUSH_ERR = 'error: Trying to write non-commit object'


INVALID_TAGS_MESSAGE = '''\

Some refs pointed to tag objects and the anchor-ref-format option was
configured to push anchor refs to refs/heads.
Unfortunately git does not allow tags to be pushed there, so the commit objects
they point to have been pushed instead.
As a result the anchored systems cannot be built with the current definitions.

To remedy this either:

1.  Re-configure the git server to allow pushes to outside of refs/heads and
    change anchor-ref-format to the new namespace

    i.e. Allow pushes to refs/tags/{trove_id} and run with
    --anchor-ref-format=refs/tags/{trove_id}/anchors/{name}/{commit_sha1}

2.  Amend definitions so that the following refs are replaced with their listed
    commit. The anchors that were pushed will remain appropriate to preserve
    reproducibility with the amended definitions.

            anchor refs are used to keep a release buildable, so when
            support for the release is dropped, the anchors may be
            dropped.

        *   `REPO` - repository url to definitions repository.

            For a locally checked out repository, this would be
            `file://$(pwd)`

        *   `REF` - name of branch in definitions repository.
