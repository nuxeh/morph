        '''Create a visualisation of build dependencies in a system.

        Command line arguments:

        * `REPO` is a repository URL.
        * `REF` is a git reference (usually branch name).
        * `MORPHOLOGY` is a system morphology.

        This produces a GraphViz DOT file representing all the build
        dependencies within a system, based on information in the
        morphologies.  The GraphViz `dot` program can then be used to
        create a graphical representation of the dependencies. This
        can be helpful for inspecting whether there are any problems in
        the dependencies.

        Example:

            morph graph-build-depends baserock:baserock/morphs master \
                devel-system-x86_64-generic > foo.dot
            dot -Tpng foo.dot > foo.png

        The above would create a picture with the build dependencies of
        everything in the development system for 64-bit Intel systems.

        GraphViz is not, currently, part of Baserock, so you need to run
        `dot` on another system.
