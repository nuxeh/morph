        Command line arguments:

        * `GITANO-COMMAND` is the Gitano command to invoke on the Trove.
        * `ARG` is a Gitano command argument.

        This invokes Gitano commands on the Trove host configured
        in the Morph configuration (see `--trove-host`).

        Trove is the Codethink code hosting appliance. Gitano is the
        git server management component of that.

        Example:

            morph trovectl whoami
            morph trovectl help

        '''

        trove = 'git@' + self.app.settings['trove-host']
        self.app.runcmd(['ssh', trove] + args,
            stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None)
