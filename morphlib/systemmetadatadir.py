class SystemMetadataDir(collections.MutableMapping):

    '''An abstraction over the /baserock metadata directory.

    This allows methods of iterating over it, and accessing it like
    a dict.

    The /baserock metadata directory contains information about all of
    the chunks in a built system. It exists to provide traceability from
    the input sources to the output.

    If you create the object with smd = SystemMetadataDir('/baserock')
    data = smd['key'] will read /baserock/key.meta and return its JSON
    encoded contents as native python objects.

    smd['key'] = data will write data to /baserock/key.meta as JSON

    The key may not have '\0' characters in it since the underlying
    system calls don't support embedded NUL bytes.

    The key may not have '/' characters in it since we do not support
    morphologies with slashes in their names.
