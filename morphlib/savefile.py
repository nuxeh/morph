class SaveFile(file):

    '''Save files with a temporary name and rename when they're ready.

    This class acts exactly like the normal ``file`` class, except that
    it is meant only for saving data to files. The data is written to
    a temporary file, which gets renamed to the target name when the
    open file is closed. This avoids readers of the file from getting
    an incomplete file.

    Example:

        f = SaveFile('foo', 'w')
        f.write(stuff)
        f.close()

    The file will be called something like ``tmpCAFEBEEF`` until ``close``
    is called, at which point it gets renamed to ``foo``.

    If the writer decides the file is not worth saving, they can call the
    ``abort`` method, which deletes the temporary file.
